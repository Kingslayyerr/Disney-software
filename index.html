    <h1>Managing Software Projects at Walt Disney Imagineering</h1>
    <p>The management of software dev projects at Walt Disney Imagineering differs from other type of project management in several respects: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Software is invisible.</li> 
      <li>Software development is primarily a ”thinking” rather than a “producing” effort.</li>
      <li>All software is a prototype.</li>
      <li>The producers and the thinkers are often the same people.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Management of software projects is fundamentally based on estimates yet software estimates are notoriously poor. Engineers get little training on how to do estimates, and often get little, if any, feedback on whether their estimate was any good.</p>
    <h2>
Making the Software Mesh with the Overall Project
</h2>
    <p>Software and firmware for Disney theme park rides and shows are developed as part of a larger project that encompasses the entire attraction. The larger project includes the development of shows, mechanical, and electrical parts of the ride, as well as the software for the ride control system. This document thus talks about two kinds of projects: the software development project (the central subject of this doc) and the larger attraction development project, which the software development effort is a part of. The term “project” in this doc refers to the software development project. The terms “overall project” and “overall attraction project” refer to larger projects for developing the entire attraction. </p>
    <p>When a project includes software and non-software products, software strategy should mesh nicely with the overall project strategy. Thus it is important to identify the elements of the overall project strategy that may affect software strategy. Elements of the project strategy that affect software may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Internal meetings.</li>
      <li>Internal milestones.</li>
<li>Major Work Products—Specify the content and timing of any work products or submittals that the software effort is required to provide to others. Also, identify what specific approvals are required of those products before they may be submitted.</li>
<li>Perceived Risks—Specify any risks perceived by the project that involve the software effort.</li>
<li>Organizational Structure—Specify the internal management structure of the project. Include organizational boundaries and interfaces, including the names of personnel and their roles.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Identifying the Project’s Stakeholders</h2>
    <p>A project’s stakeholders are the people chosen to represent all of the company’s interests for the project. This may be a single person or a group. Managing a software project means ensuring that the product delivered matches the stakeholders’ expectations. You must therefore, identify all stakeholders, and the interests that they represent. Typical interests represented on a Disney project include creativity, development, and customers.</p>
    <p>One stakeholder, or several may represent a single interest in the project. A stakeholder might represent a department, but “cross-hatting” often occurs. For example, a stakeholder from operations might represent both the operations and maintenance interests in the early stages of a project. Guests can only be represented indirectly, primarily through creative, but also through all stakeholders. </p>
    <p>Projects usually have more than one stakeholder. These individuals sometimes have disagreeing interpretations of product requirements. In your plan, identify the person who has the authority to resolve such conflict when necessary. Usually this person is Project Manager, but you should clarify whether this is so for your project.</p>
    <p>Formal approval may reside with a Project Manager alone, or with several different stakeholders, depending on the nature of the authorization being sought. Regardless, the Project Manager, acting on behalf of the proper balance of all interests, should ensure that all effected interests are satisfied. Throughout the project, make sure that the Project Manager and all pertinent stakeholders are informed of any activities that would affect their interests.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Give all team members a <a href="contact-list.com">contact list</a> to ensure that the responsibilities of all members of the team and lines of communication within the project are not confused. Identify stakeholders by name and by the interests they represent, rather than by department. Check the list often, as it frequently changes throughout the project.
