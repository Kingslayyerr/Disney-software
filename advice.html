    <h1>Advice on the Software Management Plan</h1>
    <p>A Software Management Plan is a strategy for managing a project in order to produce the intended software products with acceptable quality. It encompasses all aspects of project. It is first document prepared, and it is maintained throughout the life of the project.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Plans come in a variety of shapes and sizes; tiny projects may involve simple, perhaps even informal, plans, whereas huge projects will involve more complicated and formal plans. However, all plans must point to documents that contain the following info:</p>

    <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Scope of the Project—The products that you must design and implement, any other related activities that you must support, and the environment and overall project in which you must run the project.</li> 
      <li>Software Strategy—The way which you will meet the project’s goals.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>


    <div>
    <p>A plan at its core is a forecast. It is impossible to know with certainty whether it will be successful. When people evaluate a plan to determine if it has a good strategy (e.g., whether the resulting quality will be good enough), they are essentially applying their expertise to the specified strategy to envision the outcome. You can dramatically increase the likelihood of your plan’s success by having your plan reviewed by other experienced, knowledgeable personnel. For this reason, your functional supervisor must to approve all plans and significant changes to plans before they can be implemented.</p>


    <p>Make sure that a realistic and achievable plan exists and is approved before you proceed. This requirement also applies to projects for which you are presented with an existing, pre-approved plan. Make sure that you confirm with this existing plan before proceeding. </p>


    <p>It is critical that you define a plan that you believe will work. You may be asked to modify your plan to optimize some particular aspect, but you have to be absolutely sure that the end result is a plan that you believe will work. If you are asked to modify or revise you plan, make sure do so in a manner that still results in a plan that you feel confident about. (Remember, many different plans can achieve the same goal.)</p>

    <p>A successful project satisfies all of the specified scope elements, but also <i>only</i> the specified scope elements. 
    Unless it occurs as a side effect, it is generally considered inappropriate from a management perspective for a project to satisfy elements other than those specified, because it implies that the project could have used fewer resources.
    </p>

    <p> Having a quality plan does not assure a project’s success—the plan must be continually managed.</p>
